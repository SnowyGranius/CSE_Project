Porosity: 
  Triangle has a narrower distribution and higher porosity for the same packing fraction. Square has a wide distribution and lower porosity.

Surface: 
  Rectangle slightly higher surface for the same pf.

Euler mean volume:
  Same between the shapes for every pf, control Minkowski.

Permeability/Energy:
  Shoots up for the smallest pf. Rectangle noticeably less permeable
