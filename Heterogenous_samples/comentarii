Porosity: 
  Triangle has a narrower distribution and higher porosity for the same packing fraction. Square has a wide distribution and lower porosity.

Surface: 
  Narrower distribution and smaller values for triangle.

Euler mean volume:
  Same between the shapes for every pf, control Minkowski.

Permeability/Energy:
  Rectangle is less permeable than triangle for high pf, but performs better than triangle for a lower pf.
